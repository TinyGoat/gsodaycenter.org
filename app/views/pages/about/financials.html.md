  Doing a lot on a little.

The IRC started small and hasn't forgotten its roots. Carefully leveraging volunteer hours and partnerships, the IRC has figured out how to do a lot on very little.

 We are financially frugal and take pride in that. We don't duplicate or provide services that are already being done well by our partner agencies. Instead, we come up with innovative, new ideas developed in conjunction with people experiencing homelessness to make straight-forward, dynamic and impactful programs.
