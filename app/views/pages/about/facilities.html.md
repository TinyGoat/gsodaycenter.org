The IRC is located in downtown Greensboro, only one block from The Depot. The large IRC building is a place for people to come, to congregate, to join in community. Perhaps you have come to take a class, perhaps you have come to get your mail. Perhaps you have come to sit in our dayroom, have a conversation, or just be.

The IRC offers everything from showers facilities to a computer lab to a mail room to classrooms and meeting spaces. Our building is surrounded by organic, edible gardens that are free for the picking. We have turned a formerly industrial lot into a vibrant hub of community activity.
