<p>The KCM Success Fund is an endowment created by Greensboro native Steven Morton in honor of his son, Kenny. Prior to taking his life in 2013, Kenny had accompanied his father to IRC functions and participated with our community.</p>

<p>Steven Morton started the fund with a goal of helping others and to honor his son. "Kenny's initials were KCM, and those initials stand for Knowledge, Courage and Motivation as the keys to success. I'm trying to help provide the K - the C and M are up to the individuals," said Morton.</p>

<p>The KCM Success Fund will provide access for those experiencing homelessness to pursue an education with the goal of helping individuals gain the skills necessary to obtain living-wage jobs.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the IRC partnered with GTCC to bring select classes from the school to the center. Locating classes at the IRC will greatly reduce barriers to education access for one of Greensboro's most vulnerable populations.</p>

<p>If you would like to honor Kenny and support the KCM Success Fund, you can donate  <%= link_to 'online', "http://www.irc.webconnex.com/sustainers" %> or by mail to the address below.</p>
